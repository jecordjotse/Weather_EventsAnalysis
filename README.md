## WEATHER EVENTS ANALYSIS

This is a final project for the Reproducible Research. It is a weather
events analysis based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks
characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States,
including when and where they occur, as

as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The storm data can be found

## FINAL PROJECT

In my final report I answer two questions; 1- Across the United States,
which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most
harmful with respect to population health? 2- Across the United States,
which types of events have the greatest economic consequences? Some data
cleaning is perform before the data is explored for desciptive analysis.
The report is found on my RPUB page at \<\> Also in [this link]()

\#\#DISCLAIMER This report is for academic purposes and should not be
used for decision making that can affect lives and economies. It is done
to my best of knowledge as a Data Science Learner. Nonetheless, the data
can be used to make your own inference. This Report is also made to be
as Reproducible as possible, therefor is for some reason the report is
good to be used, follow through to verify before use. Thank You
